# Self-Driving Perception Model in Simulation

This repository contains the implementation of the research paper [Towards Optimal Strategies for Training Self-Driving Perception Models in Simulation](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/simulation-strategies/). The paper focused on the birdâ€™s-eye-view vehicle segmentation task with multi-sensor data (cameras, lidar) using the open-source simulator CARLA, and evaluated the framework on the real-world dataset nuScenes. This implementation uses only the camera sensor for the task.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and the necessary packages installed. Consider creating a virtual environment for this project.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
# source venv/Scripts/Activate  # Windows

python train.py


```
